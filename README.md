# Syrax Draw

A *whiteboard* or *infinite canvas* SDK allows developers to create flexible, collaborative drawing spaces, ideal for teaching environments, brainstorming, or diagramming. It provides tools to build interfaces where users can interact in real-time, draw, add notes, and annotate on a canvas with no size limits. These tools typically support various types of visual content, like images, text, and shapes, and may include advanced options like layer control, object selection and editing, and real-time synchronization for a smooth collaborative experience.
